vm_request_duration_seconds_count
vm_request_duration_seconds_sum
give me differences
vm_request_duration_seconds_count and vm_request_duration_seconds_sum are two different metrics that are commonly used in monitoring the performance of web applications.

vm_request_duration_seconds_count is a counter that keeps track of the total number of requests that have been made to the application. Each time a new request is made, the counter is incremented by one. This metric is useful for understanding how many requests the application is handling over a given period of time.

vm_request_duration_seconds_sum is a sum of the total time taken by all requests processed by the application. Each request's processing time is added to this sum. This metric is useful for understanding the total amount of time the application is taking to process all the requests it receives.

To put it simply, vm_request_duration_seconds_count tells you how many requests were processed, while vm_request_duration_seconds_sum tells you how long it took to process those requests.

It's worth noting that you can use these two metrics together to calculate the average duration of each request, which is a useful metric for understanding the overall performance of the application. The formula for calculating the average duration is:

vm_request_duration_seconds_sum / vm_request_duration_seconds_count

/api/v1/query vs api/v1/query_range
/api/v1/query and /api/v1/query_range are two different endpoints of the Prometheus Query API, used to retrieve time series data from Prometheus.

/api/v1/query is used to query a single point in time. This endpoint returns the value of a specific metric at a specific point in time, based on a given query. For example, you can use /api/v1/query to retrieve the CPU usage of a server at a specific timestamp.

On the other hand, /api/v1/query_range is used to query a range of time. This endpoint returns a range of time series data over a specified time period, based on a given query. For example, you can use /api/v1/query_range to retrieve the CPU usage of a server over the last hour, with data points every 5 minutes.

In summary, /api/v1/query is used to retrieve a single data point at a specific timestamp, while /api/v1/query_range is used to retrieve a range of data points over a specified time period.

/api/v1/series
/api/v1/series is an endpoint of the Prometheus Query API used to retrieve a list of time series that match a given set of label selectors.

When you query /api/v1/series with a set of label selectors, Prometheus returns a list of time series that match those selectors. The response contains information about the name of each time series, along with its labels and current values.

For example, you can use /api/v1/series to retrieve a list of all time series that belong to a specific metric name, like this:

bash
Copy code
/api/v1/series?match=up
This query will return a list of all time series that have the metric name "up" in their label set.

Another example is to retrieve a list of all time series that belong to a specific job, like this:

bash
Copy code
/api/v1/series?match=up{job="myapp"}
This query will return a list of all time series that have the metric name "up" and the label "job" with a value of "myapp" in their label set.

In summary, /api/v1/series is used to retrieve a list of time series that match a set of label selectors, allowing you to query and analyze the data in a more granular way.

api/v1/label/{}/values
/api/v1/label/{}/values is an endpoint of the Prometheus Query API used to retrieve the distinct values of a given label name in the time series data.

When you query /api/v1/label/{}/values, you replace the {} in the endpoint URL with the name of the label you want to retrieve the distinct values for. Prometheus will return a list of all the distinct values that appear in the label for all the time series in the database.

For example, you can use /api/v1/label/job/values to retrieve a list of all the distinct values that appear in the "job" label for all the time series in the database. This can be useful for identifying all the different jobs that are being monitored by Prometheus.

Another example is to use /api/v1/label/__name__/values to retrieve a list of all the distinct metric names that appear in the time series data. This can be useful for identifying all the different metrics that are being monitored by Prometheus.

In summary, /api/v1/label/{}/values is used to retrieve a list of all the distinct values that appear in a specific label for all the time series in the Prometheus database, allowing you to better understand the data being monitored.

vm_request_duration_seconds_sum{path="api/v1/query_range"} 5.103

by using the above metrics how do calculate latency
To calculate the latency for the api/v1/query_range path using the metrics you provided, you can use the following steps:

Calculate the average request duration: To do this, you need to divide the sum of vm_request_duration_seconds_sum by the count of vm_request_duration_seconds_count. In this case, the sum is 5.103 and the count is 66745, so the average request duration is 0.0000766 seconds (5.103 / 66745).

Calculate the latency for each percentile: To do this, you can use the values of vm_request_duration_seconds for each quantile. For example, the 50th percentile has a value of 0.05 seconds. Latency is typically defined as the time it takes for a request to receive a response, so you need to subtract the average request duration from each quantile value to get the actual latency. In this case, the latency for the 50th percentile is 0.0499234 seconds (0.05 - 0.0000766).

Repeat step 2 for each percentile: You can repeat step 2 for the other quantiles to get the latency for the 90th, 97th, 99th, and 100th percentiles.

Overall, these steps will give you an idea of the latency for the api/v1/query_range path based on the metrics you provided. Keep in mind that latency can vary depending on a variety of factors, so it's important to monitor this metric over time and identify any trends or anomalies.

http_response_duration_ms{quartile="0.5"}
http_response_duration_m{le="0.1"}

difference between those two metrics
The two metrics http_response_duration_ms{quartile="0.5"} and http_response_duration_m{le="0.1"} differ in their use of the Prometheus Histogram metric type and the way they measure response duration.

http_response_duration_ms{quartile="0.5"} uses a Histogram to measure the response duration in milliseconds and calculates the 50th percentile (or median) of the response duration for all requests. The quartile="0.5" label specifies that the metric is measuring the 50th percentile, which means that 50% of requests have a response duration below the reported value.

On the other hand, http_response_duration_m{le="0.1"} also uses a Histogram to measure the response duration, but it calculates the count of requests with response duration less than or equal to 0.1 milliseconds. The le label stands for "less than or equal to" and specifies the upper bound of the bucket for the Histogram. In this case, the metric is counting the number of requests with response duration less than or equal to 0.1 milliseconds.

In summary, http_response_duration_ms{quartile="0.5"} reports the median response duration for all requests, while http_response_duration_m{le="0.1"} reports the count of requests with response duration less than or equal to 0.1 milliseconds.

How to convert these http_response_duration_m{le="0.1"} to quantile
To convert the http_response_duration_m{le="0.1"} metric to a quantile, you can use the Prometheus query language to calculate the desired quantile value from the Histogram data. Here's an example query:

scss
Copy code
histogram_quantile(0.5, sum(rate(http_response_duration_m_bucket[5m])) by (job, le))
This query calculates the 50th percentile (or median) response duration from the http_response_duration_m{le="0.1"} metric, using the histogram_quantile function. The rate(http_response_duration_m_bucket[5m]) part of the query calculates the per-second rate of requests falling into each bucket of the Histogram over the last 5 minutes. The sum() function aggregates the rates for each job and bucket label value. Finally, the histogram_quantile(0.5, ...) function calculates the 50th percentile value from the aggregated data.

You can modify the 0.5 parameter in the histogram_quantile function to calculate a different quantile value. For example, to calculate the 90th percentile value, you would use histogram_quantile(0.9, ...).

what is the meaning of quantile
A quantile is a statistical term that represents a division of a given data set into equal-sized subgroups or intervals. Each subgroup contains an equal proportion of the data set, with the size of the subgroup depending on the number of subgroups or intervals defined.

For example, the median is a type of quantile that divides a data set into two equal-sized groups, where 50% of the data is below the median value and 50% is above it. Similarly, the 90th percentile is a type of quantile that divides a data set into ten equal-sized groups, where 90% of the data is below the 90th percentile value and 10% is above it.

In the context of monitoring systems, quantiles are often used to measure the distribution of response times or other performance metrics across requests or events. For example, the 95th percentile of response times for a web service might be used as a measure of the service's overall performance. By looking at different quantiles, you can get a more complete picture of how the data is distributed, and identify any outliers or performance issues.
